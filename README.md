## Project 1: Identifying Fraud from Enron Email.

The Enron scandal, publicized in October 2001, eventually led to the bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation. The company would build an asset, such as a power plant, and immediately claim the projected profit on its books, even though it hadnâ€™t made one dime from it. If the revenue from the power plant were less than the projected amount, instead of taking the loss, the company would then transfer these assets to an off-the-books corporation, where the loss would go unreported.

This is a machine learning project to identify person of interest by trying to uncover patterns in the dataset that contains 126 (non-poi) and 18 (poi) after removing outliers.

Among 144 observations there are 19 numerical features, and 1 label named poi which takes may take one of the two labels:

1. non-poi: Non Person of Interest
2. poi: Person of Interest


## Relevant files pertaining to Project 1:

### A.ipynb, B.ipynb, C.ipynb, D.ipynb, E.ipynb, F.ipynb, G.ipynb, H.ipynb,

Each of the .ipynb files is a Python notebook representing a dataset on which the classifiers are fitClassifiers have been fit on 8 different datasets. Each dataset is different, (may have different missing value imputation methods, different feature lists etc)

To view the code, download the .ipynb files and open using Jupyter Notebook.

### Refer to the *Enron.pdf* to understand how each dataset differs.
Also, references have been added in Enron.pdf

### poi_id.py contains the final chosen algorithm and feature list.
